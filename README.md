# Project Title

This project is a Task Management API built with FastAPI, demonstrating the integration of SQLAlchemy for database management, Pydantic for data validation, and JWT tokens for secure authentication and authorization. It provides a robust implementation of CRUD operations for managing users and tasks, with features such as user registration, login, task creation, updating, and deletion. This project aims to serve as a learning resource for handling authentication, role-based access control, and database migrations in a scalable, maintainable FastAPI application.
